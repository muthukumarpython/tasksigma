# TaskSigma Project Overview

**TaskSigma** is an advanced AI project designed to explore and implement cutting-edge techniques in autonomous task-solving using large language models (LLMs). The project leverages two powerful frameworks, **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)** and **CAMEL (Communicative Agents for "Mind" Exploration of Large Language Model Society)**, to enable intelligent agents to reason, act, and collaborate effectively on complex tasks.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of the TaskSigma project are:

- **Autonomous Task Solving**: Develop intelligent agents capable of independently reasoning through tasks, making decisions, and taking actions to achieve specified goals.
- **Collaborative Agent Interaction**: Implement a framework where multiple agents can communicate and collaborate to complete tasks more effectively than a single agent.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Ensure the system can handle various types of tasks and adapt to different problem domains with minimal human intervention.

## Key Components

### 1. **ReAct Framework**

The ReAct framework integrates reasoning and action-taking capabilities within LLMs. It allows an agent to:

- **Generate reasoning traces**: The agent can think through a problem before deciding on the best action to take.
- **Perform actions**: Based on its reasoning, the agent interacts with the environment, such as querying a database or making API calls.
- **Iterate**: The agent can update its reasoning based on the results of its actions, leading to more informed decisions.

### 2. **CAMEL Framework**

CAMEL focuses on enabling cooperation between communicative agents. It facilitates:

- **Role-Playing Scenarios**: Agents are assigned distinct roles, such as "User" and "Assistant," and work together to solve a task.
- **Inception Prompting**: Structured prompts guide the agents through their roles and tasks, ensuring they stay focused on the objectives.
- **Autonomous Cooperation**: Agents can communicate and adapt to new information as they progress through a task, making decisions collaboratively.

### 3. **Task Management**

The TaskSigma project includes a robust task management system that:

- **Coordinates Task Execution**: Manages the flow of tasks, ensuring that the right agents are assigned to the right tasks.
- **Tracks Progress**: Logs and monitors the progress of tasks, enabling detailed analysis and reporting.
- **Supports Multiple Tasks**: Can handle a variety of tasks, from simple data processing to complex decision-making scenarios.

## Project Structure

The TaskSigma project is organized into several key directories:

- **src/**: Contains the source code, including implementations of the ReAct and CAMEL frameworks, task management, and utility functions.
- **docs/**: Documentation files, including this overview and detailed descriptions of the project components.
- **tests/**: Unit tests for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the project components.
- **data/**: Input and output data directories for task execution, including sample data and results.

## Getting Started

To get started with TaskSigma, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**:
    - Clone the repository.
    - Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Configuration**:
    - Modify the configuration files in `src/config/` to set up your environment and tasks.

3. **Running Tasks**:
    - Use the `main.py` script to execute tasks. You can specify which task to run in the configuration files.
