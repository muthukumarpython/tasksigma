# ReAct Framework Documentation

The **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)** framework is a core component of the TaskSigma project. It integrates reasoning and action-taking capabilities into large language models (LLMs), enabling them to autonomously interact with environments and solve tasks by combining logical reasoning with actionable steps.

## Overview

ReAct allows agents to:

- **Reason**: Think through a problem, generate reasoning traces, and decide on the best course of action.
- **Act**: Interact with the environment based on the reasoning, such as querying APIs, searching databases, or performing calculations.
- **Iterate**: Use the results of actions to update the reasoning, refining decisions and actions iteratively.

## Components

### 1. **ReActAgent**

The `ReActAgent` class is the central implementation of the ReAct framework. It manages the reasoning and acting processes, enabling the agent to solve tasks autonomously.

- **Initialization**:
    - The `ReActAgent` is initialized with a configuration dictionary that specifies API keys, model parameters, and environment settings.
    - Example:
    ```python
    config = {
        'api_key': 'your_api_key',
        'model': 'gpt-4',
        'temperature': 0.7,
        'max_tokens': 1500,
        'environment': {
            'type': 'api',
            'endpoint': 'https://example.com/api',
            'headers': {
                'Authorization': 'Bearer your_token'
            }
        }
    }
    agent = ReActAgent(config)
    ```

- **Reasoning**:
    - The `reason` method generates reasoning traces based on a given prompt. This is the thinking phase where the agent considers different possibilities.
    - Example:
    ```python
    reasoning_trace = agent.reason("How can we optimize our workflow?")
    ```

- **Acting**:
    - The `act` method performs an action based on the reasoning, such as making an API call or querying a database.
    - Example:
    ```python
    action_result = agent.act("Query the database for recent metrics.")
    ```

- **Running the Full Cycle**:
    - The `run` method combines reasoning and acting in a full cycle, where the agent reasons, acts, and then updates its reasoning based on the results.
    - Example:
    ```python
    result = agent.run("How do we increase team productivity?")
    ```

### 2. **ReAct Utilities**

The ReAct framework includes several utility functions that support the agent's operations.

- **`process_environment`**:
    - Processes data received from the environment to prepare it for reasoning.
    - Example:
    ```python
    processed_data = process_environment(raw_data)
    ```

- **`format_reasoning`**:
    - Formats the reasoning trace to be more readable or suitable for the next action.
    - Example:
    ```python
    formatted_reasoning = format_reasoning(reasoning_trace)
    ```

- **`validate_action`**:
    - Validates an action before it is executed to ensure it is reasonable and within constraints.
    - Example:
    ```python
    if validate_action(action):
        result = agent.act(action)
    ```

### 3. **Environment Interaction**

The ReAct framework is designed to interact with external environments, such as APIs or databases.

- **Environment Configuration**:
    - The environment configuration is part of the agent's setup, where you specify the type of environment, endpoint, and headers needed for API interactions.

- **Example Interaction**:
    ```python
    environment_config = {
        'type': 'api',
        'endpoint': 'https://example.com/api',
        'headers': {
            'Authorization': 'Bearer your_token'
        }
    }
    agent.environment = environment_config
    response = agent.act("Fetch the latest data.")
    ```

## Use Cases

The ReAct framework is versatile and can be applied to various use cases:

- **Data Analysis**: The agent can reason about data trends and query relevant databases to support its analysis.
- **Task Automation**: Automate complex workflows by reasoning through the steps needed and performing actions to complete tasks.
- **Decision Support**: Provide recommendations or decisions based on a combination of reasoning and real-time data retrieval.

## Example Task

Here is a brief example of how ReAct might be used in a task:

1. **Task**: Optimize resource allocation for a project.
2. **Prompt**: "How should resources be allocated to maximize project efficiency?"
3. **Reasoning**: The agent considers different allocation strategies based on past data.
4. **Action**: The agent queries a project management API to retrieve the latest resource usage data.
5. **Iteration**: The agent updates its reasoning based on the data and suggests a new allocation plan.

## Best Practices

- **Prompt Design**: Carefully design prompts to guide the agent's reasoning and actions effectively.
- **Environment Configuration**: Ensure the environment configuration is accurate and secure, especially when interacting with external APIs.
- **Validation**: Always validate actions before executing them to avoid errors and unintended consequences.

## Conclusion

The ReAct framework in TaskSigma provides a powerful tool for integrating reasoning and acting capabilities in AI agents. By combining logical reasoning with actionable steps, ReAct enables agents to autonomously solve complex tasks and interact with their environment in a meaningful way.
