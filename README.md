# TaskSigma

**TaskSigma** is an advanced AI project that integrates two powerful frameworks: **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)** and **CAMEL (Communicative Agents for "Mind" Exploration of Large Language Model Society)**. This project aims to explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) in complex task-solving by combining reasoning, action, and cooperative agent behavior.

## Project Overview

TaskSigma leverages the latest advancements in AI to create a system where agents can autonomously cooperate to solve complex tasks. The project implements:

- **ReAct Framework**: A method that combines reasoning and action in LLMs, allowing them to interact with environments, perform tasks, and update their reasoning based on observations.
- **CAMEL Framework**: A role-playing framework where communicative agents collaborate to complete tasks with minimal human intervention.

## Features

- **Autonomous Cooperation**: Agents can communicate and collaborate to complete tasks.
- **Inception Prompting**: A sophisticated prompt engineering technique that guides agents through their roles and tasks.
- **Modular Design**: The codebase is organized into reusable modules, making it easy to extend and adapt to new tasks.
